        <h2>Visualizing Carbon Footprints</h2>
        <p>Understanding the scale of carbon emissions can be challenging. Numbers like "1 megatonne of COâ‚‚" are difficult to comprehend. Trees provide a tangible, natural measure that helps us visualize our environmental impact.</p>

            <p class="highlight">A single mature tree can absorb an average of 21-22 kg of carbon dioxide per year.</p>

        <h2>Why This Calculator Matters</h2>
        <ul class="benefit-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Making Abstract Concrete:</strong> Converting emissions data into trees needed helps contextualize environmental impact in terms we can understand.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Country-Level Perspective:</strong> Seeing how many trees would be required to offset a country's daily emissions provides a powerful visualization of our collective carbon footprint.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Species-Specific Data:</strong> Different tree species absorb carbon at different rates. Our calculator uses real scientific data about tree species prevalent in each country.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Awareness Building:</strong> Understanding the magnitude of tree-planting needed drives home the importance of both carbon reduction and forest preservation.

            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h3>Carbon Capture</h3>
                <p>Trees absorb COâ‚‚ during photosynthesis, storing carbon in their biomass and releasing oxygen.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                <p>Forests provide habitat for countless species, supporting complex ecosystems essential for planetary health.</p>

            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h3>Air Quality</h3>
                <p>Trees filter air pollutants, improving the air we breathe and reducing respiratory diseases.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h3>Water Cycle</h3>
                <p>Trees regulate the water cycle, preventing soil erosion and flooding while ensuring clean water supplies.</p>
